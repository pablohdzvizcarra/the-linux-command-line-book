 * Used to see the text file contents of a file.
 * This command shows the content of a text file in a editor like Vim.

 * Remember that Linux system only understand numbers, so when you have a file
 * in text human-readable format like ASCII, this text format needs to be parsed
 * to a number.
 * ASCII format has a one-to-one relationship because one letter in ASCII is
 * parsed to one number.
